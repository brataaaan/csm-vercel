### A customer is just getting started with Vercel and has questions about recommended options for third-party integrations for Monitoring or Logging. How would you respond to the customer?

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out with your questions, and for choosing Vercel for your project!

### Monitoring

For customers on our **Pro** or **Enterprise** plans, Vercel offers built-in Monitoring. This feature helps you track the health and performance of your applications in real-time.

- **Pro teams**: Monitoring can be enabled from **Settings > Billing** in your team`s dashboard.
- **Enterprise teams**: Please **contact our sales team** to set up a customized monitoring plan based on your specific needs.

For more details, check out our [Monitoring documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/monitoring/quickstart).

### Logging

Vercel offers several types of logs, depending on your plan and use case:

- **Activity Logs**: These logs provide a chronological view of events on your personal or team account, such as deployment changes and updates to environment variables. Available to Pro and Enterprise customers.
- **Audit Logs**: Designed for Enterprise customers (currently in beta), Audit Logs track team members' actions, helping you verify who accessed specific features and when.
- **Build Logs**: Generated during the deployment process, Build Logs show you the progress and details of each deployment. Available to all Vercel plans.
- **Runtime Logs**: These logs let you inspect and search logs for deployed projects in real-time. They are retained for 3 days, but you can extend this using Log Drains. Available to all Vercel plans.
- **Log Drains**: Log Drains allow you to export log data to third-party services for easier debugging and analysis. You can configure them through the Vercel dashboard or choose from available integrations in our [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace?category=logging). Available for Pro and Enterprise customers.

For more detailed information, visit our [Logging documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/logs).

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,  
Johannes
