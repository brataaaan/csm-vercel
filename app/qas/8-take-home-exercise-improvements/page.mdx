### How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?

I believe this exercise is creative and engaging, effectively showcasing Vercel`s user-friendly technology and encouraging applicants to become familiar with the platform and its documentation.

One suggestion I have is to avoid locking applicants into a specific project template. Part of the role involves finding and recommending relevant resources for different customer projects, so allowing applicants to choose the most suitable project template could better reflect this aspect of the job.

For example, I realized early on that a markdown-centric project would be the best fit for this exercise. Some fitting example projects I might have chosen include:

- [Blog Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/blog-starter-kit)
- [Nextra: Docs Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/documentation-starter-kit)

Other than this, I think the exercise is very well thought out and requires only minor adjustments.
