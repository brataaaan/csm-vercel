### A customer has a project on Vercel and they want to know about best practices when it comes to redirects. Write a reply to the customer.

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out with your question, and for choosing Vercel for your project!

When it comes to implementing redirects, here are some best practices to ensure everything runs smoothly:

1. **Test thoroughly**: Always test your redirects in a preview deployment to ensure they work as expected before pushing them to production.
2. **Use relative paths**: In the destination field, use relative paths to avoid hardcoding your domain name. This keeps your redirects flexible and easier to maintain.
3. **Choose the correct redirect type**: Use **permanent redirects** (HTTP status code 301) for permanent URL changes and **temporary redirects** (HTTP status code 302) for temporary moves.
4. **Be cautious with wildcards**: Wildcards are powerful but should be used carefully. For example, if you use a wildcard in a source rule that matches any URL path, you could unintentionally redirect all traffic to a single destination, which might break your site.
5. **Prioritize HTTPS**: Use redirects to enforce HTTPS across all requests to your domain, ensuring a secure connection for your users.

For more detailed information on setting up redirects on Vercel, you can refer to our [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#redirects).

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, please don`t hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,  
Johannes
