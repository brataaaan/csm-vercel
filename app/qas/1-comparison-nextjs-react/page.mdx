### Please compare the similarities and differences between Next.js and React. A high-level overview is sufficient (up to a couple of paragraphs). No need to write an essay!

React is a **JavaScript library** used for building user interfaces by breaking them into reusable components. It focuses primarily on rendering views and managing UI state, but it doesn't prescribe how to handle other concerns like routing, data fetching, or server-side rendering.

Next.js, on the other hand, is a **full-stack framework** built on top of React. It extends React by offering additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and built-in routing. Next.js also includes out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, CSS modules, image optimization, and API routes, making it a more comprehensive solution for building web applications.

While React is unopinionated and leaves many decisions to the developer, Next.js provides a structured, opinionated approach, which can speed up development by reducing decision fatigue. One key advantage of Next.js is its seamless integration with Vercel, enabling easy deployment and scaling of applications.

For further details, the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs) provides an excellent starting point for learning both React and Next.js.
