### Background: I am a CISO for a firm that just signed on for Enterprise with Vercel Secure Compute. I am looking forward to meeting you for an onboarding session to talk about the security products Vercel offers as well as go over the state of our customer journey.

### ---

### Question: What resources would you want to prepare to make sure that the CISO has everything they need to succeed as they migrate to the Enterprise version of the platform? Feel free to use documentation from vercel.com, and our YouTube channel to find assets to help.

To ensure a smooth onboarding session for a CISO migrating to Vercel's Enterprise Plan with Secure Compute, I would prepare the following key resources and topics:

1. **Vercel Secure Compute**:  
   A detailed overview of Secure Compute, focusing on private networks, dedicated IPs, and secure connections for Serverless Functions. This is crucial for integrating your backend infrastructure securely.
   - _[Vercel Secure Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute)_
1. **Security Certifications and Compliance**:  
   Vercel complies with ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and more. We'll discuss how these certifications align with your firm’s compliance requirements and ensure you meet industry standards.
   - _[Security & Compliance Measures](https://vercel.com/docs/security)_
1. **Vercel Firewall**:  
   An introduction to Vercel`s firewall, including DDoS protection, IP blocking, and custom rule management to safeguard your applications from security threats.

1. **Shared Responsibility Model**:  
   Discussion of Vercel`s Shared Responsibility Model, clarifying the security responsibilities Vercel handles and what falls under your firm’s scope. This is critical for understanding the division of roles in maintaining security.
   - _[Shared Responsibility Model](https://vercel.com/docs/security/shared-responsibility)_
1. **Infrastructure**:
   Overview of Vercel's infrastructure, including its global Edge Network, data centers, and how Vercel ensures high availability and performance.
   - _[Infrastructure](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure)_

**To ensure we cover everything important, I recommend the CISO prepares the following:**

- A list of the customers current security concerns and goals.
- An overview of the customers existing infrastructure and how you plan to integrate it with Vercel.
- Specific compliance or regulatory needs.
- Questions on how Vercel's security features align with your security policies and risk management.
