### A customer has reached out asking, “When should I choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?ˮ Write a reply to the customer. If you use documentation or AI as a guide, please only use it to guide your answer. Put it in your own words, please! Feel free to reference documentation in your answer though.

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out to us with your question! I'm happy to help you understand when to choose between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel.

#### Edge Functions

Edge Functions are perfect when you need:

- **Fast responses**: They run across Vercel's global Edge Network, reducing latency by processing requests closer to the user.
- **Efficient cost management**: Ideal for tasks like querying APIs or databases, as costs are based on the compute time, making them budget-friendly for tasks with longer processing times.
- **Lightweight operations**: If your tasks require minimal compute power and a smaller runtime, Edge Functions are a good choice.
- **Global reach**: All Edge Functions are distributed globally, making them an excellent fit for worldwide applications.

#### Serverless Functions

Serverless Functions are best when your application demands:

- **More computational resources**: They provide more memory and CPU, which is useful for heavier, more complex tasks.
- **Larger payloads**: They handle bigger files and more data.
- **Full Node.js compatibility**: If your application relies on specific Node.js APIs, Serverless Functions offer complete support.
- **File system operations**: Unlike Edge Functions, Serverless Functions can interact with the file system, making them ideal for tasks like file uploads or complex processing.

#### Edge Middleware

Edge Middleware is ideal for scenarios where you need:

- **Request pre-processing**: It operates before requests hit your cache or application logic, allowing you to modify responses on the fly.
- **Personalized user experiences**: If your application involves personalization—like content customized based on user location, authentication, or A/B testing—Edge Middleware can deliver tailored results without delay.
- **Special use cases** like:
  - Authentication checks
  - Geolocation-based content or routing
  - Language-based content delivery
  - Bot detection or blocking

#### **Which one should you choose?**

- If you need **fast, low-latency responses** for lightweight tasks, go with **Edge Functions**.
- For **more processing power** and **full Node.js support**, use **Serverless Functions**.
- If you want to **customize responses before they reach your main application** or enable personalization, consider **Edge Middleware**.

I hope this clarifies your decision! Feel free to reach out if you need more guidance, or if there are specific use cases you'd like to explore further.

Best regards,  
Johannes
